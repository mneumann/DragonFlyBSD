 *
 * 2. Virtual times.  These increase in steps of len/x, where len is the

/*
 * Overall structure of dummynet (with WF2Q+):
 *
 * In dummynet, packets are selected with the firewall rules, and passed to
 * two different objects: PIPE or QUEUE.
 *
 * A QUEUE is just a queue with configurable size and queue management policy.
 * It is also associated with a mask (to discriminate among different flows),
 * a weight (used to give different shares of the bandwidth to different flows)
 * and a "pipe", which essentially supplies the transmit clock for all queues
 * associated with that pipe.
 *
 * A PIPE emulates a fixed-bandwidth link, whose bandwidth is configurable.
 * The "clock" for a pipe comes from an internal timer.  A pipe is also
 * associated with one (or more, if masks are used) queue, where all packets
 * for that pipe are stored.
 *
 * The bandwidth available on the pipe is shared by the queues associated with
 * that pipe (only one in case the packet is sent to a PIPE) according to the
 * WF2Q+ scheduling algorithm and the configured weights.
 *
 * In general, incoming packets are stored in the appropriate queue, which is
 * then placed into one of a few heaps managed by a scheduler to decide when
 * the packet should be extracted.  The scheduler (a function called dummynet())
 * is run at every timer tick, and grabs queues from the head of the heaps when
 * they are ready for processing.
 *
 * There are three data structures defining a pipe and associated queues:
 *
 *  + dn_pipe, which contains the main configuration parameters related to
 *	delay and bandwidth;
 *  + dn_flow_set, which contains WF2Q+ configuration, flow masks, plr and
 *	RED configuration;
 *  + dn_flow_queue, which is the per-flow queue (containing the packets)
 *
 * Multiple dn_flow_set can be linked to the same pipe, and multiple
 * dn_flow_queue can be linked to the same dn_flow_set.
 * All data structures are linked in a linear list which is used for
 * housekeeping purposes.
 *
 * During configuration, we create and initialize the dn_flow_set and dn_pipe
 * structures (a dn_pipe also contains a dn_flow_set).
 *
 * At runtime: packets are sent to the appropriate dn_flow_set (either WFQ
 * ones, or the one embedded in the dn_pipe for fixed-rate flows), which in
 * turn dispatches them to the appropriate dn_flow_queue (created dynamically
 * according to the masks).
 *
 * The transmit clock for fixed rate flows (ready_event()) selects the
 * dn_flow_queue to be used to transmit the next packet. For WF2Q,
 * wfq_ready_event() extract a pipe which in turn selects the right flow using
 * a number of heaps defined into the pipe itself.
 */

/*
 * Per flow queue.  This contains the flow identifier, the queue of packets,
