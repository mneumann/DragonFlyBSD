/*
 * The implementation is designed to avoid looping when compatible operations
 * are executed.
 *
 * To acquire a spinlock we first increment lock.  Then we check if lock
 * meets our requirements.  For an exclusive spinlock it must be 1, of a
 * shared spinlock it must either be 1 or the SHARED_SPINLOCK bit must be set.
 *
 * Shared spinlock failure case: Decrement the count, loop until we can
 * transition from 0 to SHARED_SPINLOCK|1, or until we find SHARED_SPINLOCK
 * is set and increment the count.
 *
 * Exclusive spinlock failure case: While maintaining the count, clear the
 * SHARED_SPINLOCK flag unconditionally.  Then use an atomic add to transfer
 * the count from the low bits to the high bits of lock.  Then loop until
 * all low bits are 0.  Once the low bits drop to 0 we can transfer the
 * count back with an atomic_cmpset_int(), atomically, and return.
