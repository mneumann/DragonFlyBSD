/*
 * Physical file format (binary)
 *
 * All raw records are 128-bit aligned, but all record sizes are actual.
 * This means that any scanning code must 16-byte-align the recsize field
 * when calculating skips.  The top level raw record has a header and a
 * trailer to allow both forwards and backwards scanning of the journal.
 * The alignment requirement allows the worker thread FIFO reservation
 * API to operate efficiently, among other things.
 *
 * Logical data stream records are usually no larger then the journal's
 * in-memory FIFO, since the journal's transactional APIs return contiguous
 * blocks of buffer space and since logical stream records are used to avoid
 * stalls when concurrent blocking operations are being written to the journal.
 * Programs can depend on a logical stream record being a 'reasonable' size.
 *
 * Multiple logical data streams may operate concurrently in the journal,
 * reflecting the fact that the system may be executing multiple blocking
 * operations on the filesystem all at the same time.  These logical data
 * streams are short-lived transactional entities which use a 13 bit id
 * plus a transaction start bit, end bit, and abort bit.
 *
 * Stream identifiers in the 0x00-0xFF range are special and not used for
 * normal transactional commands. 
 *
 * Stream id 0x00 indicates that no other streams should be active at that
 * point in the journal, which helps the journaling code detect corruption.
 *
 * Stream id 0x01 is used for pad.  Pads are used to align data on convenient
 * boundaries and to deal with dead space.
 *
 * Stream id 0x02 indicates a discontinuity in the streamed data and typically
 * contains information relating to the reason for the discontinuity.
 * JTYPE_ASSOCIATE and JTYPE_DISASSOCIATE are usually emplaced in stream 0x02.
 *
 * Stream id 0x03 may be used to annotate the journal with text comments
 * via mountctl commands.  This can be extremely useful to note situations
 * that may help with later recovery or audit operations.
 *
 * Stream id 0x04-0x7F are reserved by DragonFly for future protocol expansion.
 *
 * Stream id 0x80-0xFF may be used for third-party protocol expansion.
 *
 * Stream id's 0x0100-0x1FFF typically represent short-lived transactions
 * (i.e. an id may be reused once the previous use has completed).  The
 * journaling system runs through these id's sequentially which means that
 * the journaling code can handle up to 8192-256 = 7936 simultaneous
 * transactions at any given moment.
 *
 * The sequence number field is context-sensitive.  It is typically used by
 * a journaling stream to provide an incrementing counter and/or timestamp
 * so recovery utilities can determine if any data is missing.
 *
 * The check word in the trailer may be used to provide an integrity check
 * on the journaled data.  A value of 0 always means that no check word
 * has been calculated.
 *
 * The journal_rawrecbeg structure MUST be a multiple of 16 bytes.
 * The journal_rawrecend structure MUST be a multiple of 8 bytes.
 *
 * NOTE: PAD RECORD SPECIAL CASE.  Pad records can be 16 bytes and have the
 * rawrecend structure overlayed on the sequence number field of the 
 * rawrecbeg structure.  This is necessary because stream records are
 * 16 byte aligned, not 24 byte aligned, and dead space is not allowed.
 * So the pad record must fit into any dead space.  THEREFORE, THE TRANSID
 * FIELD FOR A PAD RECORD MUST BE IGNORED.
 *
 * NOTE: ENDIAN HANDLING.  Data records can be in little or big endian form.
 * The receiver detects the state by observing the 'begmagic' field.  Each
 * direction in a full-duplex connection can be operating with different
 * endianess.  Checksum data is always calculated on the raw record (including
 * dead space) in a byte-stream fashion, and then converted to the transmit
 * endianess like everything else.  If the receiver's endianess is different
 * it must convert it back to host normal form to compare it against the
 * calculated checksum.

/*
 * Each logical journaling stream typically represents a transaction...
 * that is, a VFS operation.  The VFS operation is written out using 
 * sub-records and may contain multiple, possibly nested sub-transactions.
 * multiple sub-transactions occur when a VFS operation cannot be represented
 * by a single command.  This is typically the case when a journal is 
 * configured to be reversible because UNDO sequences almost always have to
 * be specified in such cases.  For example, if you ftruncate() a file the
 * journal might have to write out a sequence of WRITE records representing
 * the lost data, otherwise the journal would not be reversible.
 * Sub-transactions within a particular stream do not have their own sequence
 * number field and thus may not be parallelized (the protocol is already
 * complex enough!).
 *
 * In order to support streaming operation with a limited buffer the recsize
 * field is allowed to be 0 for subrecords with the JMASK_NESTED bit set.
 * If this case occurs a scanner can determine that the recursion has ended
 * by detecting a nested subrecord with the JMASK_LAST bit set.  A scanner
 * may also set the field to the proper value after the fact to make later
 * operations more efficient. 
 *
 * Note that this bit must be properly set even if the recsize field is
 * non-zero.  The recsize must always be properly specified for 'leaf'
 * subrecords, however in order to allow subsystems to potentially allocate
 * more data space then they use the protocol allows any 'dead' space to be
 * filled with JLEAF_PAD records.
 *
 * The recsize field may indicate data well past the size of the current
 * raw stream record.  That is, the scanner may have to glue together
 * multiple stream records with the same stream id to fully decode the
 * embedded subrecords.  In particular, a subrecord could very well represent
 * hundreds of megabytes of data (e.g. if a program were to do a
 * multi-megabyte write()) and be split up across thousands of raw streaming
 * records, possibly interlaced with other unrelated streams from other
 * unrelated processes.  
 *
 * If a large sub-transaction is aborted the logical stream may be
 * terminated without writing out all the expected data.  When this occurs
 * the stream's ending record must also have the JREC_STREAMCTL_ABORTED bit
 * set.  However, scanners should still be robust enough to detect such
 * overflows even if the aborted bit is not set and consider them data
 * corruption.
 * 
 * Aborts may also occur in the normal course of operations, especially once
 * the journaling API is integrated into the cache coherency API.  A normal
 * abort is issued by emplacing a JLEAF_ABORT record within the transaction
 * being aborted.  Such records must be the last record in the sub-transaction,
 * so JLEAF_LAST is also usually set.  In a transaction with many 
 * sub-transactions only those sub-transactions with an abort record are
 * aborted, the rest remain valid.  Abort records are considered S.O.P. for
 * two reasons:  First, limited memory buffer space may make it impossible
 * to delete the portion of the stream being aborted (the data may have
 * already been sent to the target).  Second, the journaling code will
 * eventually be used to support a cache coherency layer which may have to
 * abort operations as part of the cache coherency protocol.  Note that
 * subrecord aborts are different from stream record aborts.  Stream record
 * aborts are considered to be extrodinary situations while subrecord aborts
 * are S.O.P.
